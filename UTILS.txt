CAMPAIGN MANAGER 2024 -- Utility Guide

Python is required to run these scripts.

python custom_us.py [vanilla CAMPAIGN 2024 ROM filename] [custom map filename]

Allows a custom map (EC, STATE LEANS, ISSUES) to be modded into a CAMPAIGN MANAGER 2024 ROM (C64 only). The new ROM [original name+"mod"] is your custom ROM.

Custom map format: (an original game map is included as an example)
MAP NAME (this line is ignored)
STATE 1 (ME): R LEAN, D LEAN, ISSUES, EC
e.g. 7,9,2,3,5,5,4,4
STATE 2...
STATE 51 (HI)...
newline  

See "custom1984.txt" for an example -- this is the original CAMPAIGN MANAGER map.

python random_map.py [output custom map filename] [custom map name]

Generates a random map text file, made to be as even as possible in a 2-player match. Apply to the ROM using the custom map proceedure.

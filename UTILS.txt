CAMPAIGN MANAGER 2024 -- Utility Guide

Python is required to run these scripts.

custom_us.py / apply_custom.bat

Allows a custom map (EC, STATE LEANS, ISSUES) to be modded into a CAMPAIGN MANAGER 2024 ROM (C64 only). Rename ROM file to "camp", the custom map file into "custom.txt", and run apply_custom.bat; the new file "campmod" is your custom ROM.

Custom map format: (the original game map is included as an example)
STATE 1 (ME): R LEAN, D LEAN, ISSUES, EC
e.g. 4,5,2,3,5,5,4,4
STATE 2...
STATE 51 (HI)...
newline  

random_map.py

Generates a random map, made to be as even as possible in a 2-player match. Apply using the custom map proceedure.
